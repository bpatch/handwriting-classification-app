# handwriting-classification-app
Contains two streamlit apps: one to make handwritten data and one to classify based on new input (uses random forests, naive Bayes and convolutional neural networks). 

These are the steps that were taken to build the app:

1. Write handwriting-data-app.py
2. Open handwriting-data-app.py locally by executing "streamlit run handwriting-data-app.py" in a terminal in the working directory containing the files of this repository.
3. Training many samples for each number (I did about 10 for each number): (i) select what the number is, draw the number, click 'Add data', repeat, then (ii) click 'Save data'. 
4. Run the file 'handwriting_classification.py' to create and train the 3 models (which will be stored in 'forest', 'nb' and the 'cnn' folder. 
5. Find images of wizards on https://www.pngaaa.com/.
6. Write Dockerfile and requirements.txt
7. Start a virtual machine (vm) on digitalocean (may require a vm with 16GB RAM for tensorflow). 
8. Place all files in a folder on the vm. 
9. Build the Docker image by executing "docker build -t  wizards:alpha ."
10. Run the Docker image by executing "docker run -p 8501:8501 wizards:alpha"
11. Enjoy the app!

I wrote these notes for myself, but if you are reading up to here I hope they have been useful to you too! 

Extras: 
- Once the app is running in the container, its files can be copied using "docker container cp CONTAINER:/app ./"
- Currently the cnn model deletes a folder and then rewrites it during learning. This causes the app to break when there are multiple users. 
- The learning part of workflow could be done locally before being run on the server (reducing the RAM requirement of the server).
